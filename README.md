# COMP324

Final Project for COMP 324: Client-Side Web Development. 

We collaborated on a team of five to create a web application for an eCommerce fashion company, ThreadCore. 

Thread Core is a high-end ecommerce space for individual artists or brands to showcase their product to a larger audience than they can reach on their own. The shopping experience is primarily executed in a collections or drop format, falling on specific dates. Thread Core serves as a marketplace that allows the customer to access individual artists and smaller brands all in one place.

Skills: Utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Firebase
